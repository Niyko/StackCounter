### :rocket: Project structure
Plugin is build as hibrid as to work in Chrome and Firefox, `common/common.js` and some parts of the `popup/popup.js` contains code that only works on chrome and some only on firefox (Beacause I can't figure out how to make it workable on both)
* `/popup` contains the extenstion popup page
* `/common` contains scripts that is common and used all around the code
* `page_runner.js` runs on the stackoverflow page
* `version.txt` extension uses this file for knowing current version and show update alert
